In the first section we added a UI slider component, <br />we added the component to the audio manager script,<br />and we linked the audio to the slider that will receive the same value all the time. - <a href="https://github.com/moshelh/cow_galaxy/blob/master/introduction/Assets/Script/AudioManager.cs">audio manger</a>

In the second part: We added a gameobject to hold an audio component,
And script too.
In script we created a function that schedules the sound playback between 20 and 200 seconds. - <a href="https://github.com/moshelh/cow_galaxy/blob/master/introduction/Assets/Script/CowSound.cs">cow-sound</a>

In the third part we added animation to the cow that when it explodes then the animation is activated. -<a href="https://github.com/moshelh/cow_galaxy/blob/master/introduction/Assets/Script/Enemy.cs">Player</a></span></pre>
